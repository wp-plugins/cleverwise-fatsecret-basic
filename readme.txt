Easily integrate the FatSecret Platform JavaScript API into your WordPress powered site.

== Description ==

<p>Now you may easily integrate (add) the FatSecret Javascript information to your WordPress powered site without having to be a programmer!</p>

<p>No more struggling with code you don't understand.  No more searching the Internet for unhelpful posts on a quest to get the FatSecret system to display.  No more banging your head on the desk.  No more... well you get the point!</p>

<p>All of those frustrations are gone! Poof, like smoke in the wind. When you install this plugin you simply fill out three pieces of information (including the theme/layout), add a provided small snippet of WordPress information to your desired page/post, then simply direct your visitors to your newly integrated area.  It is as easy as one, two, three!</p>

<p>This is very convenient isn't it? You might even be thinking where has this plugin been all this time? Well regardless the fact remains it is now here!  So what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>Language Support: English only since that is the language of choice for the FatSecret Platform JavaScript API.</p>
